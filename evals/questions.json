Many top commenters like \"liferay-continuous-integration\", \"codecov-commenter\", \"poiana\", and \"coveralls\" are clearly CI/automation systems despite not having \"bot\" in their names. If we're looking for actual human users, breathx (41 comments on 1 thread) or qperie (33 comments on 1 thread) would be stronger candidates, though their activity patterns (many comments on single threads) could also indicate automated behavior."
